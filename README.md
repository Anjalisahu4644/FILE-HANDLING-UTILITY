## Project Description:
The **File Handling Utility** is a Java-based project designed to demonstrate essential file operations, including reading, writing, and modifying text files. This utility provides a simple yet effective way to interact with text files, ensuring efficient data management.

File handling is a fundamental skill in software development, applicable in various real-world scenarios such as **log management, configuration files, and data storage systems**. This project showcases the power of Javaâ€™s built-in file handling libraries and provides an interactive command-line interface (CLI) for users to perform file operations seamlessly.

## Task Details:
- **Task Objective:** Develop a Java program that can read, write, and modify text files.
- **Key Functionalities:**
  - Writing new data to a file
  - Reading content from a file
  - Modifying existing file content
- **Tools & Technologies Used:**
  - **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required for compiling and running Java programs.
  - **Java Standard Libraries:** `java.io.*` and `java.nio.file.*` for handling files.
  - **Scanner Class:** Used for user input handling.
  - **BufferedReader & BufferedWriter:** Ensures efficient file reading and writing.
- **Editor/Platform Used:**
  - **IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code** for development.
  - **Command Prompt / Terminal** for running the application.

## Features:
- **Write to File:**
  - Allows users to input text and store it in a file.
  - Appends new data without erasing previous content.
- **Read from File:**
  - Displays file content in a structured format.
  - Helps users verify stored data.
- **Modify File:**
  - Enables users to replace specific text in a file.
  - Uses efficient search-and-replace techniques to update content.
- **Exit Option:**
  - Provides a safe way to close the application.
  - Ensures that all file operations are completed before termination.

## Applicability:
- **Data Logging & Storage:** Used for maintaining logs in applications.
- **Configuration Management:** Helps in managing software settings stored in text files.
- **Text Processing:** Useful in applications requiring manipulation of text-based data.
- **Software Development:** A foundation for more complex file-based applications.

## How to Run the Program:
1. Ensure **Java is installed** on your system. You can verify by running:
   ```sh
   java -version
   ```
   If Java is not installed, download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Save the Java file as `FileHandlingUtility.java`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
4. Compile the program using:
   ```sh
   javac FileHandlingUtility.java
   ```
5. Run the compiled Java program:
   ```sh
   java FileHandlingUtility
   ```
6. Follow the on-screen menu to perform file operations.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Enhance usability with a graphical interface instead of a CLI.
- **Encryption & Security:** Implement encryption techniques to secure sensitive file data.
- **Multi-file Support:** Extend functionality to handle multiple files at once.
- **Database Integration:** Store file data in a database like MySQL for better scalability.
- **Advanced Search Features:** Implement keyword-based search for quick retrieval of information.

## Conclusion:
This project provides a fundamental understanding of **Java's file handling capabilities**. It serves as a stepping stone for developers looking to work with file systems, text data, and basic storage solutions. By implementing these features, the project helps in developing essential programming skills applicable in **data storage, system logging, and configuration management**.
